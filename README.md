# üìå Training Management Angular Project

## üß† Overview

This README provides essential instructions for working with an Angular project, likely named "TrainingManagement". It serves as a quickstart guide for developers, covering common tasks such as running the application, generating components, building the project, and testing. This project leverages the power of the Angular CLI for efficient development and deployment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

This project utilizes the Angular CLI and provides the following core features:

*   **Development Server:**  Allows for rapid development with automatic updates.
*   **Component Generation:** Simplifies the creation of new components, directives, pipes, and services.
*   **Project Building:**  Creates optimized production-ready builds.
*   **Unit Testing:** Enables testing individual components and modules.
*   **End-to-End Testing (E2E):** Allows for testing the application's behavior from a user's perspective (requires an E2E testing package).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js and npm (or yarn):**  The package manager for JavaScript.
*   **Angular CLI:**  Globally installed to manage your Angular project. You can install it with: `npm install -g @angular/cli`

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:** (Assuming you have the project source code)  If you don't have the project yet, you'll need to clone it from your repository, e.g., `git clone <repository_url>`. Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your repository.

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**  Use your terminal/command prompt to change your current working directory: `cd <project_directory>`. Replace `<project_directory>` with the name of the project directory.

3.  **Install project dependencies:**  Use npm (or yarn) to install the required packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if using yarn:
    yarn install
    ```

## üöÄ How to Run / Usage Instructions

Here's how to perform common tasks within the project using the Angular CLI:

*   **Run the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```

    This command starts a development server and automatically opens your application in your default web browser. The application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:4200/`.  The server will automatically reload the application whenever you make changes to the source code.

*   **Generate a New Component (or other Angular elements):**

    ```bash
    ng generate component <component-name>
    # Examples:
    # ng generate component my-new-component
    # ng generate service my-new-service
    # ng generate pipe my-new-pipe
    # ng generate directive my-new-directive
    ```

    Replace `<component-name>` (or other element name) with the desired name for your new component. The CLI will create the necessary files (HTML, CSS/SCSS, TypeScript, and a unit test file) and automatically update your project's module files.

*   **Build the Project for Production:**

    ```bash
    ng build
    ```

    This command compiles your application and creates optimized production-ready files. The build artifacts are stored in the `dist/` directory.  You can then deploy the contents of the `dist/` folder to a web server.

*   **Run Unit Tests:**

    ```bash
    ng test
    ```

    This command runs your unit tests using Karma, a test runner for JavaScript, and outputs the results in your terminal.

*   **Run End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**

    ```bash
    ng e2e
    ```

    This command runs your end-to-end tests (e.g., using Protractor or Cypress).  **Note:** You will need to have an E2E testing package (like Protractor) configured in your project for this command to work correctly.

*   **Get Further Help:**

    ```bash
    ng help
    ```

    This command provides help information for the Angular CLI. You can also refer to the official Angular CLI documentation for more detailed information: [https://angular.io/cli](https://angular.io/cli)
